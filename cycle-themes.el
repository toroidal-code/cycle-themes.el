;;; Commentary:

;; Allows switching between themes easily.

;;; Installation

;; In your Emacs config, define a list of themes you want to be
;; able to switch between.  Then, enable the global minor mode.
;;
;;     (setq cycle-themes-theme-list
;;           '(leuven monokai solarized-dark))
;;     (require 'cycle-themes)
;;     (cycle-themes-mode)
;;
;; `cycle-themes' is bound to 'C-c C-t' by default.
;;
;; You can optionally add hooks to be run after switching themes:
;;
;; (add-hook 'cycle-themes-after-cycle-hook
;;           #'(lambda () (Do-something-fn ...)))
